            <h2>About the Petition</h2>
            <p>In late 2023, Warren’s part-time City Council passed a law doubling their own salaries and tying future raises to the city's highest paid employee. This Citizens’ Initiative seeks to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set Council pay to a reasonable amount</li>
                <li>Freeze all elected officials' pay at current levels</li>
                <li>Require all future pay changes to be decided by the voters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We need over <strong>1,000 signatures</strong> by <strong>July 31, 2025</strong> to place this on the November ballot.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Is it true that these political pay raises were needed to give prosecutors in the law department a raise?</strong><br>
            A: No. Warren City Council has granted raises to prosecutors and other city employees in the past without increasing their own salaries. This claim is misleading.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Does this initiative affect union contracts or city employees?</strong><br>
            A: No. It only affects elected officials—not union or city employees.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do Warren’s elected official salaries compare to similar cities?</strong><br>
            A: Council members in Warren make nearly 3 times more than those in Mansfield, often used for comparison in police negotiations.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Does this initiative correct the current pay structure?</strong><br>
            A: Yes. It freezes elected officials’ pay and eliminates unethical automatic increases.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is Warren the only city with this automatic raise structure?</strong><br>
            A: Yes. This initiative will fix that and return fairness to government pay.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What does signing the petition do?</strong><br>
            A: It puts the initiative on the November 4, 2025 general election ballot.</p>
