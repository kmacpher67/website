            <p>
                In the final days of 2023, Warren’s part-time City Council passed a law to double their own salaries.
                Worse, they tied future raises to the highest-paid city employee—creating a self-serving, automatic pay hike scheme.
                Meanwhile, Mansfield—a similar-sized "sister city"—pays its council members less than <strong>$10,000</strong> annually.

                <strong>This is not just greedy. It’s wrong.</strong> We can fix this with your help. All we ask is:
                <strong>Get just 10 signatures</strong> from friends and family this Memorial Day weekend. That alone could change the future of our city.
