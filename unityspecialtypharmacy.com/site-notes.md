Typography Recommendations
The logo uses a combination of two distinct styles: a modern, rounded geometric font for "UNITY" and a classic high-contrast serif for "Pharmacy."

1. For the "UNITY" Motif (Geometric/Rounded Sans-Serif)
The logo uses a customized font with rounded terminals and "joined" characters. To replicate this modern look in HTML, use Google Fonts for easy integration.

Closest Match: Comfortaa (specifically weights 600 or 700). It captures the rounded, friendly, and geometric nature of the word "Unity."

Alternative: Quicksand. It is slightly more professional and less "bubbly" but keeps the rounded ends.

2. For the "Pharmacy" Motif (Modern Serif)
The word "Pharmacy" is set in a high-contrast serif that resembles classic "Didone" styles but is slightly more utilitarian.

Closest Match: Bodoni Moda or Playfair Display. Both offer the sharp contrast between thick and thin lines seen in the logo.

Standard Web-Safe Alternative: Georgia, serif;

3. For the Tagline (Clean Sans-Serif)
"UNITED FOR YOUR HEALTH" is a standard, clean, all-caps sans-serif.

Recommendation: Montserrat (Weight 700).
